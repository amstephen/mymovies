 /*THE API WE ARE BUILDING , IS BASED ON
    FETCHING MOVIES/FILMS FROM A CERTAIN SITE
    AND WE DECODE THE FORMAT INTO JSON FORMAT.

    WHAT I OBSERVED IS THAT 
 => THE API DOES NOT NEED DATABASE SINCE WE ARE JUST 
    FETCHING DATA AND  DISPLAY  INTO TO OUR LOCAL SERVER

 => SO WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOME FUNCTIONS THAT WILL HELP
    EASE THE TASK OF FETCHING DATA FROM THE SITE AND 
    DISPLAYING IT TO OUR LOCAL SERVER
